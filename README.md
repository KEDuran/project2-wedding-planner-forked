## Project Description

**Summer weddings** are in full swing!! To help make wedding planning easier, we would like to develop a _wedding planner web application_ that will help any wedding planner easily plan and organize all the details surrounding the big day. This proposed application will allow users to create a profile under which they can create **one** or **more** wedding plans.

## Concept

This platform will leverage a full stack web application that will allow `planning` and `management` of a clientâ€™s wedding. Weddings are significant events in people's lives and as such, couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are well-organized. Wedding Planner allows you to keep all of your guests, invitations, and more in one place.

#### Design

This section addresses the platforms's basic functionality and style/design utilized for the multiple features included thorughout the site.

#### Architecture

This project is based on **MVC design** (_model-view-control_) which facilitates a better orhganziation pattern for the code used to develop this web application. The MVC folder pattern helps separate the application's care back-end business logic, front-end UI design, and user interaction. The diagram included below outlines the architecture of this web application.

##### ER Diagram

The entity relationship (ER) diagram below provides a visual representation of how the data is saved inside the application's back-end database. This diagram also include demosntrates the relations between each database table.
